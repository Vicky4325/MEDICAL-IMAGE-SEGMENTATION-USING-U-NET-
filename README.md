# MEDICAL-IMAGE-SEGMENTATION-USING-U-NET-
Deep Neural Network Models for Accurate Medical Image Segmentation
Abstract
Image segmentation is one of the most critical steps in image processing and computer vision, as it enables the division of an image into meaningful regions or pathological structures. Accurate segmentation plays a vital role in image analysis and object classification, particularly in medical imaging, where precision directly impacts diagnosis and treatment planning.
Image segmentation techniques are broadly categorized into Semantic, Instance, and Panoptic segmentation. In the medical domain, segmentation is extensively used to analyze MRI scans, CT scans, and X-ray images for identifying anatomical structures and detecting abnormalities. It is also widely applied in biomedical research tasks such as cell counting, tissue analysis, and anatomical structure evaluation.
The integration of machine learning significantly enhances segmentation accuracy and efficiency by automating labeling, training, and testing processes. This project presents a machine learning–based approach to semantic image segmentation, where each pixel is classified into a specific category. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is employed, combined with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and robustness. The proposed model is trained on a large-scale dataset and evaluated using multiple performance metrics, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability. The developed system has potential applications in medical imaging, autonomous driving, and object detection.
Objectives of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a deep learning–based framework for accurate and efficient medical image segmentation. The specific objectives are as follows:
1.	To develop a robust medical image segmentation model using deep neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2.	To accurately segment medical images by classifying pixels into meaningful anatomical or pathological regions.
3.	To enhance model performance and generalization by applying transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.
4.	To evaluate the proposed segmentation model using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection over Union (IoU).
